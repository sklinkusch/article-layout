      Cody Wilson, champion of the 3D-printed handgun, is facing sexual assault charges. It will likely do nothing to
      slow the march of his brainchild.</p>

        Cody Wilson used one word to summarize the culminating event in his years-long lawsuit against the U.S.
        government:
        “Epochal.”</p>
      <p>
        This was in July, when news became public about the Department of Justice reaching a legal settlement with
        Defense
        Distributed, the Texas nonprofit Wilson founded in 2012 to help distribute 3D-printed firearms. And the
        response
        was
        what I expected from Wilson, a 30-year-old provocateur prone to self-mythologizing. I met him in 2014, when he
        was
        26, after he had successfully designed, manufactured, and test-fired the Liberator, the world’s first fully
        3D-printed gun. That breakthrough, and his subsequent effort to disseminate the blueprint to anyone with an
        internet
        connection, unleashed all manner of hell.</p>
      <p>
        Wilson has long been a showman, equal parts ideologue and 1960s ad man, prone to philosophical meandering and
        asseverations about state tyranny and possessing a penchant for deliberately poking the political class. His
        sincerity was often questioned, but even four years removed, I knew what a victory over the federal government
        meant
        to him. It meant that Cody Wilson had come tantalizingly close to his dream of dismembering U.S. gun control.</p>
      <p>
        “I don’t have to argue philosophically now,” he said during a short phone call at the end of August. “I only
        have
        to
        argue the law.”</p>
      <p>
        Two weeks later, the law caught up to Wilson, albeit in a far different way. He was arrested in Taiwan and
        extradited
        to the United States for allegedly sexually assaulting a 16-year-old girl. He met her on SugarDaddyMeet.com,
        used
        his
        real name, called himself a “big deal,” picked her up in an SUV registered to Defense Distributed, took her to
        a
        hotel, had sex with her, and paid her five $100 bills, according to an affidavit by Shaun Donovan, a detective
        with
        the Austin Police Department. On September 21, the day of his arrest, Wilson resigned from the company.</p>
      <p>
        The scandal inspired a measure of glee in Wilson’s opponents. “But the NRA told us Cody Wilson was a good guy
        with
        a
        gun…,” Shannon Watts, founder of gun-control advocacy group Moms Demand, wrote on Twitter.</p>
      <p>
        The following Tuesday, however, Paloma Heindorff, vice president of operations at Defense Distributed,
        introduced
        herself as the nonprofit’s new director. Heindorff, a three-year veteran of the company, struck a defiant
        attitude
        during a press conference, describing her employees as “resilient” and parrying all queries about Wilson’s new
        legal
        predicament. Reporters present asked the obvious question: How does Defense Distributed continue on without
        Cody
        Wilson? Heindorff had an answer at the ready. “We believe in something, and that something isn’t one man,” she
        said.
        “That something is an idea, and we are fully committed to that idea.”</p>
      <p>
        For a moment, it may have seemed that the idea of 3D-printed guns might follow Cody Wilson down. But the idea
        Heindorff invokes — the idea that gun control as we know it can be destroyed by giving every American the
        capacity
        to
        build their own guns — may simply be too powerful to stop.</p>

      <p>
        Before 2013, Cody Wilson had used 3D printing to successfully manufacture rifle magazines and the AR-15 lower
        receiver (the piece, regulated by the federal government, that is required to actually operate the rifle). But
        it
        wasn’t until he released the Liberator that he became notorious. After Wilson uploaded the digital blueprints
        to
        Defcad.com, a clearinghouse Defense Distributed set up to share its various computer-aided design files for gun
        components, plans for the Liberator were downloaded 100,000 times. Two days later, Wilson dropped out of law
        school
        at the University of Texas. A couple days after that, the State Department ordered him to take his files
        offline,
        citing arms export control law. Because people in other countries could download those files, the government
        argued,
        Defense Distributed was illegally trafficking guns. Wilson complied and shut down Defcad.</p>
      <p>
        The Defcad files had been offline for a year and a half when I visited Defense Distributed’s Austin-based
        factory
        in
        2014. That December, Wilson was preparing an entirely different project: the Ghost Gunner, a desktop milling
        machine
        that enables even know-nothing machinists to mill a four-fifths-finished aluminum lower receiver to completion.
        Because purchasing what’s called an “80 percent lower” doesn’t require a background check, users of the Ghost
        Gunner
        could complete the component and then purchase the remaining parts of an AR-15 rifle — also without a
        background
        check — to build an untraceable firearm. Wilson said he sold out a preorder of 500 machines, grossing $700,000,
        and
        teased his forthcoming legal battle. “There will be a Defense Distributed v. United States that those bastards
        at
        UT
        law will have to read one day,” he told me then.</p>
      <p>
        True to his word, in May 2015, Defense Distributed used the money from Ghost Gunner sales to sue the State
        Department, essentially arguing that the federal government ordering files off the internet is akin to a prior
        restraint of speech. In doing so, it coupled the First and Second Amendments by contending that digital files
        are
        a
        form of expression. The move found unlikely supporters. Even the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press
        submitted an amicus brief in Defense Distributed’s favor. “To come after the Second Amendment now, you
        increasingly
        have to come after people’s ability to publish and communicate,” Wilson speculated four years ago.</p>
      <p>
        When the State Department ordered the company to shut down Defcad in 2013, its argument concerned only the
        alleged
        violation of federal arms export control law, not the act itself of publishing digital gun files. After all,
        technical data about guns, including their manufacture, is readily available elsewhere online and in library
        books
        about gunsmithing.</p>
      <p>
        When the government settled this year, the State Department denied that it violated Defense Distributed’s First
        and
        Second Amendment rights — and yet the settlement itself indirectly conceded the point. It gave Defense
        Distributed
        a
        license to publish all the files it had previously ordered the company to take offline, effectively agreeing
        with
        Defense Distributed’s take on the fundamental question underlying the entire legal conflict: that computer
        code,
        even
        code that can lead to the production of a functional firearm, is protected speech.</p>
      <p>
        It was a bold gambit, but a winning one. On July 27, 2018, 10 files — including the full technical plans of the
        AR-15
        and the 3D-printable design file of the Liberator — reappeared on Defcad.com. No longer was Wilson a mere
        tech-savvy
        Dennis the Menace. He was now a fully sanctioned arms dealer with the law on his side.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <p>
        The fact that Defense Distributed could continue distributing files is far less important than the broader
        implications of the fight. By savvy and subversive use of technology, Wilson had not only muddled what it means
        to
        sell, obtain, and own a gun; he had also called into question what a gun actually is, thereby transforming a
        legal
        question into a far more complicated technological problem practically inextricable from the concept of free
        expression. “I believe what I’m doing immeasurably enables the Second Amendment,” said Wilson during an
        interview
        with CBS on August 2. “It immeasurably expands it in a technical era.”</p>
      <p>
        Like Napster before it, Defense Distributed pushed America toward a new order where ownership is disordered,
        accountability is next to nil, and technology is always a few steps ahead of the law. This — anarchy,
        essentially — was always the plan. “What separated Defense Distributed from the impotent,” Wilson wrote in Come
        and
        Take It, the memoir he published in 2016, “was that when we said ‘universal access to arms,’ those who listened
        understood we meant just that… We not only meant it; we intended to take the fanatical steps to enact it.”</p>
      <p>
        Alarmed by the settlement with the federal government, state attorneys general moved in on July 30, four days
        after
        Defense Distributed’s files went back online. Eight of them sued the State Department, arguing that the
        settlement
        itself was unlawful. The next day, Judge Robert Lasnik of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of
        Washington granted a temporary restraining order. Defense Distributed had to take down the files it had just
        reposted. On August 27, by which point attorneys general from 11 other states had joined in, Lasnik extended
        the
        order by granting a preliminary injunction, effectively blocking Defense Distributed, for the time being, from
        publishing its files online.</p>
      <p>
        “Regulation under the [Arms Export Control Act] means that the files cannot be uploaded to the internet,”
        Lasnik
        wrote in his court order, adding, “but they can be emailed, mailed, securely transmitted, or otherwise
        published
        within the United States.”</p>
      <p>
        True to form, the very next day, Wilson announced the company would sell the files via thumb drive to verified
        U.S.
        persons with verified U.S. addresses, likening Defense Distributed to the iTunes of digital gun sales. On the
        first
        day, Defense Distributed made $20,000 selling branded USB sticks that contained the 10 gun files it had just
        been
        forced to remove from the internet. The move smacked of the same counter-maneuvering that has marked the
        company’s
        efforts from the beginning.</p>
      <p>
        It is ongoing. “We’re still shipping and have no intention of stopping,” Heindorff said at the September press
        conference. “We believe that people have the right to have these files.”</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <p>
        But the vision was always bigger than computer files, bigger than just getting a single-shot, 3D-printed pistol
        to
        fire. No mass shooting, no resurgent gun-control movement, no form of U.S. government could ever stand in the
        way
        of
        Defense Distributed’s first order of business: universal access to arms. Given many Americans’ strong
        attachment
        to
        the power of firearm ownership, this is an idea whose resonance will only deepen.</p>
      <p>
        The idea of universal access finds its perfect vessel in Paloma Heindorff, Wilson’s successor at Defense
        Distributed.
        Born and raised by artistic parents in central London, she grew up in a “socialist-leaning” family who was
        “definitely anti-firearm,” as she said during an episode of Tom Gresham’s syndicated radio show, Gun Talk, that
        aired
        in October 2017. It was only after she moved to New York City that Heindorff began her journey into pro-gun
        activism.</p>
      <p>
        “I was dismayed by the narrative in the world today, the idea we can be looked after by our government,” she
        told
        Gresham. “Not only is it ridiculous fundamentally, it also erodes the power that one can feel as an
        individual.”</p>
      <p>
        A libertarian friend of Heindorff’s originally turned her on to Defense Distributed. After spending a weekend
        watching slick YouTube clips of the nonprofit’s work, she emailed Wilson, received a reply, and in five weeks
        had
        moved everything she owned to Austin and took up a position at the company. In the span of two years, she went
        from
        having never fired a weapon to pulling the trigger on a .50-caliber M2 Browning machine gun.</p>
      <p>
        Heindorff didn’t respond to several email requests for comment, but it’s evident to anyone who has followed her
        that
        the idea of immeasurably enabling gun rights is as potent in Heindorff as it was in Wilson. “It’s obvious to
        everyone
        here that he’s been an incredibly powerful figurehead,” she said at the September press conference. “But this
        is
        about an idea.” Wilson may have the verve of a showman, but Heindorff has the zeal of a convert.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <p>
        Still, Heindorff must contend with one last obstacle: the preliminary injunction granted in August, a crucial,
        last-ditch effort for the states involved.</p>
      <p>
        “It’s been a happy coincidence for the states that the export laws have also protected the states themselves
        and
        their residents from these 3D-printed gun blueprints,” says Mary B. McCord, a visiting professor at Georgetown
        University Law School and former attorney with the Department of Justice. (In an article published over the
        summer,
        McCord called the First Amendment argument Wilson used in Defense Distributed’s legal fight mere “window
        dressing
        for
        his real goal: to put guns into the hands of every person who wants one.”)</p>
      <p>
        Since the preliminary injunction that took Defense Distributed’s files offline yet again, the company has
        raised
        about $400,000 to continue a legal fight it thought was over as of July. Defense Distributed filed its motion
        to
        dismiss in late October. If the case in Washington is thrown out, that protection the states have enjoyed goes
        away.
        (In the time since the motion was filed, a gunman killed 12 people at a bar in Los Angeles. Less than 24 hours
        later,
        a New Jersey law that outlaws 3D-printed guns and “ghost guns” went into effect. New Jersey Attorney General
        Gurbir
        Grewal said the law was passed “to stop the next Cody Wilson.”)</p>
      <p>
        Yet this fresh legal imbroglio has done little to halt Defense Distributed’s ultimate goal of expanding
        Americans’
        access to guns. In a rebuttal to the state attorneys general, an unassociated website, CodeIsFreeSpeech.com,
        began
        hosting all the company’s files. (“Defense Distributed’s not posting its files, but you can find them in five
        seconds
        on Google,” says Josh Blackman, the group’s attorney.) Or you can simply buy a branded USB drive, a tiny source
        of
        terror that can’t be controlled: the samizdat of lethal weaponry, coursing through the underground, forever.</p>
      <p>
        Regardless of Cody Wilson’s fate, we’ve turned a corner. There’s likely no going back. His bitterest opponents,
        as
        much as anyone, know that fact all too well.</p>
      <p>
        “Cody Wilson was the face of Defense Distributed and 3D-printed guns, but we doubt that his movement will die
        with
        his resignation,” the co-presidents of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence said in a statement after
        Wilson
        resigned. “The Pandora’s box has been opened, and it will not go away with Wilson.”</p>
